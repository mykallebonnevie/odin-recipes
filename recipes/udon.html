    <h1>Chicken Udon</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This delicious yaki udon stir-fry is similar to yakisoba, but it's made
      with thick, white udon noodles and tossed with a much simpler sauce. Often
      used in soups, udon noodles are also delicious fried — the texture is just
      awesome because they are chewy. Try to find frozen or fresh udon noodles.
      Dried udon noodles will work, but you'll lose some of the signature
      texture.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 ounces frozen udon noodles</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ pound boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded cabbage</li>
      <li>½ cup carrot matchsticks</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chile paste)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm
        to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, warm olive oil in large saucepan or wok over medium heat. Add
        chicken and sauté until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion, bell
        pepper, cabbage, carrots, and garlic. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, allowing
        vegetables to maintain most of their crispness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour soy sauce over vegetables and chicken; sauté 1 to 2 minutes more.
        Add udon noodles and toss well. Mix in gojuchang and ketchup, thoroughly
        combining to mix all the flavors. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
