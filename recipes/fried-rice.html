    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There are some dishes that always seem to be better at restaurants and
      fried rice is one of them. Not anymore! My dad has made fried rice with
      egg hundreds of times and now he's sharing his battle-tested techniques
      for cooking this essential Chinese dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      From proper stir-frying technique to why he prefers using fresh instead of
      day-old rice, my dad has lots of tips and tricks on how to make the best
      egg fried rice. Take this masterclass with a chef who has perfected it
      over the course of 50 years and you'll never have mushy, clumpy fried rice
      ever again.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>14 oz uncooked jasmine rice</li>
      <li>14 oz water</li>
      <li>2 oz carrot</li>
      <li>4 oz frozen corn and peas</li>
      <li>4 large egg</li>
      <li>0.50 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>0.30 cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rice Seasoning Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>0.50 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>0.50 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Wash & Cook Rice</h3>
        <p>
          Wash the rice (14 oz) three times, using fresh water after each rinse.
          While rice isn't very dirty, washing it removes excess starch so the
          grains aren't stuck together. Drain the rice thoroughly after the
          final rinse. Add the rice, followed by the water (14 oz) to a rice
          cooker and cook according to your rice cooker's instructions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cut Green Onions & Carrots</h3>
        <p>
          Cut the green parts off of the green onions (1 oz) and dice into small
          pieces. Save the whites to use in another dish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slice the carrot (2 oz) in half, then into strips. Hold the strips
          together and dice into small pieces. Combine with the frozen corn and
          peas (4 oz) in bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Crack & Season eggs</h3>
        <p>
          Crack the eggs (4 large) into a bowl. Season with the salt (0.50
          teaspoon), then set aside.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Microwave veggies & fluff rice</h3>
        <p>
          Once the rice is done cooking, leave it covered to steam for 2
          additional minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, add the water (0.30 cup) to the bowl of vegetables and
          microwave for 2 minutes to cook. Drain out the excess water and set
          aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the 2 minutes are up, it's time to fluff the rice! Use
          chopsticks to stir and fluff rice for 1 to 2 minutes. This allows the
          excess steam to release and prevent clumping.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Stir fry & season</h3>
        <p>
          Heat the wok on high and beat the eggs. Lower the heat to low and add
          the oil (2 tablespoon), spreading it all over wok surface to make sure
          it's well coated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add eggs and stir gently, cooking them for about 20 to 30 seconds. Add
          the cooked rice on top of the eggs, flip and stir fry constantly,
          breaking apart the clumps of rice and eggs with a wok spatula for
          about 2 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Chef's Tip: Make sure to scoop all the way to the bottom along all
          the sides of the wok and not the center, which will actually make the
          ingredients stick together.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the flat side of the spatula, press down on the rice and spread
          it over the wok to gently loosen any clumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add mixed veggies, increase the heat to high, flip and stir fry for
          another 2 to 3 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn the heat down to low. In a small bowl, combine the light soy
          sauce (1 tablespoon), dark soy sauce (1 teaspoon), salt (0.50
          teaspoon), sugar (0.50 teaspoon), and chicken bouillon powder (1
          teaspoon), if using, and pour over the rice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increase the heat to high and stir fry everything for another 2 to 3
          minutes. You can also use chopsticks to help mix the fried rice or
          toss the wok.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the oil (1 tablespoon) and diced green onions, stir fry for
          another minute to mix everything together, then turn the heat off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taste and add more seasoning if needed. My dad uses an additional 1
          teaspoon of light soy sauce this time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Plate the fried rice</h3>
        <p>
          Add some diced green onions to the bottom of a medium-sized bowl.
          Scoop the fried rice on top and compress it with the bottom of the
          spatula.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, add the water (0.30 cup) to the bowl of vegetables and
          microwave for 2 minutes to cook. Drain out the excess water and set
          aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the 2 minutes are up, it's time to fluff the rice! Use
          chopsticks to stir and fluff rice for 1 to 2 minutes. This allows the
          excess steam to release and prevent clumping.
